        <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

        <p>My name is Mickenzie Bly, but I prefer to go by Micki. I was born in Las Vegas, but moved to Colorado when I was a year old so I consider myself a native here. I decided to become a coder to expand my skillset and job oppurtunities. The tech field is growing, and I wanted to become a part of it. I have incredible attention to detail, as well as the determination and focus to become a great web developer. I have a variety of interestes, including cars, computers, and video games. 
        </p>

        <p>I own a 2011 WRX STI with quite a bit of work done. I call her Remus, and she has 322whp, very fun and fast! I enjoy taking her up to the track here in Colorado, Bandimere Speedway. Of course being a Subaru it has taken a lot of my money fixing her up, but also gave me the ambition to start working harder, saving money, wanting to succeed and finding purpose beyond just the day to day living.
        </p>

        <p>I built my own computer, I was very proud with how it turned out and how organized it was. I was intimidated at first with all these parts and wires, but it came out exactly how I wanted. It can run pretty much anything, and I'm grateful I was able to complete it before the pandemic with these supply shortages and hiking prices now. (Specs: Intel 10700k, Asus RTX 2080-Super, 64gb RAM, 1tb Samsung m.2 storage)
        </p>

        <p>The main reason why I have a fast computer is for video games of course. I love playing MTG Arena, Cities: Skylines, Overwatch, Crusader Kings 3, and Planet Zoo. Building and stategy games are among my favorite. Its a great way for me to relax when I have time off, though it really uses your brain I find it stimulating and an effective way to keep myself occupied without getting bored. 
        </p>
